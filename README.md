# BunnyHat

My Go at some offensive security tasks (ba-dum-tss):

- **toorbnny** - an HTTP brute-forcer (similar to [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) dir mode)
- **mockingbunny** - a fully interactive shell with TCP stream multiplexing

## Why yet another implementation of *X*?

### Short answer

To learn, show me how to do it better!

### Long answer:

I'm learning some golang to:
- Speed up concurrent workflows
- Remove runtime requirements
- Cross-compile native bits for multiple arch/OS targets
- Understand tools better and customize them on demand
